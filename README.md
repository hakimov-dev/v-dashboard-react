## About this project üë®‚Äçüíª
Introducing the React TS App Starter Admin Dashboard Template, a cutting-edge solution that combines the power of React and TypeScript with the elegance of Tailwind CSS. This meticulously crafted template is designed to provide developers with a solid foundation for building highly scalable and efficient admin dashboards.

With its sleek and modern design, this template offers a visually appealing user interface that is both intuitive and user-friendly. The use of Tailwind CSS ensures a responsive layout that seamlessly adapts to different screen sizes, making it suitable for various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

The template incorporates the AOS (Animate On Scroll) library, enabling stunning animations and transitions that enhance the overall user experience. By leveraging AOS, you can effortlessly bring your dashboard to life, making it more engaging and visually appealing.

One of the key strengths of this template lies in its comprehensive set of features. It provides a wide range of components and widgets, such as charts, tables, forms, and notifications, which can be easily customized and extended to meet your specific requirements. These pre-built components not only accelerate development but also ensure consistency across your application.

Thanks to the integration of React and TypeScript, the template offers a robust and type-safe development environment. TypeScript provides static typing and enhanced tooling, enabling developers to catch errors early in the development process and build more reliable applications. React, on the other hand, provides a component-based architecture that promotes code reusability and modularity, allowing for easier maintenance and scalability.

Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting your journey, the React TS App Starter Admin Dashboard Template is the perfect choice for building professional-grade admin dashboards. Its combination of React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and AOS offers a powerful toolkit that simplifies development, enhances design aesthetics, and ensures optimal performance across various devices. Embrace this template and unlock your potential to create stunning and responsive admin dashboards with ease.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
